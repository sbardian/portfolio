      <p>
        Hello, welcome to my portfolio site! I hope to update this site as I
        move on down the developer trail. So there should be fresh projects
        showing up, old projects being updated and made even more awesome than
        they where when you last checked on them! So be sure to check back often
        so you don't miss anything. I might even add a blog at some point, but
        as you have probably already gathered, I'm not much of a writer, sooo...
